Basic Platformer made with Godot engine on 11/16/24 and 11/17/24. Used online tutorial from FreeCodeCamp, documentation from Godot as well as help with certain errors from google.
Learned from scratch over 2 days, with no prior knowledge of the game engine. Lacks polish, but is not bad for the short amount of time.
